# local_suppliers
Toghether with the Gosh community we are trying to map local suppliers.

Initially we started with electronic components, but nothing stops people from adding whatever else they want. 

Currently the best way to contribute would be:
1 - add to the file named "electronic part retailers" if you want to contribute with suppliers of electronic components
2 - create a new "tab separated value" file if you want to contribute with something else, eg. suppliers for 3D printer filament
