# local_suppliers
Toghether with the Gosh community we are trying to map local suppliers.

Initially we started with electronic components, but nothing stops people from adding whatever else they want. 

Currently the best way to contribute would be:

1 - add to the file named "electronic part retailers" if you want to contribute with suppliers of electronic components

2 - create a new "tab separated value" file if you want to contribute with something else, eg. suppliers for 3D printer filament

If you are not confortable with github, open a new issue using this link https://github.com/amchagas/local_suppliers/issues, and put the information you would like to add there. State which file it should go into, or if it should go in a new file, and the content you would like to add. If there is too much too add, we might contact you and show you how to do it by yourself using github ;)
